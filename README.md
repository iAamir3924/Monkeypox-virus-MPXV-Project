# Monkeypox-virus-MPXV-Project
A guided screening approach to discover potential inhibitors for MPXV.
This repository contains all our input and out put RAW files supplemented by Desmond log files that could be viewed to confirm and validate our findings. We have provided the predicted structure, all the simulated 5 complexes, R script for Ramachandran plot analysis and Machine learning based virtual screening.
