NOTE
For conducting the Ramachandran plot analysis, we wrote and executed the following code in RStudio. The following code will load the pdb file in R, 
will extract its torsional angles and produce a gradient Ramachandran plot to validate a protein's 3D conformation. We have made this code freely available 
and we would highly appreciate if you use our code, please do cite its corresponding paper. Thank you

#Set the folder's directory
setwd("C:/Users/x/xx/xxx")

#load necessary packages
library(bio3d)
library(ggplot2)

#loading the protein (.pdb) file
> pdb <- read.pdb("rm.pdb")

#extracting and plotting the protein's torsional angles
> tor <- torsion.pdb(pdb)
> plot(tor$phi, tor$psi)

#create dataframe with phi and psi angles
> df <- data.frame(Phi=x, Psi=y)

#creating a gradient plot 
> ggplot(df, aes(x=Phi, y=Psi)) +
+ geom_hex() +
+ scale_fill_gradient(low="purple", high="green") +
+ theme_bw()

Note: After plotting, the image is exported in pdb and post-processed in Adobe Illustrator for adjusting font size.
